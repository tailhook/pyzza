Pyzza programming language
==========================

Overview
--------

Pyzza is a language with a syntax similar to Python. But it's definetly
not Python.

The aim of this language to run on ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM), and to
be easy to use scripting language for applications written in ActionScript.
Pyzza syntax should be a subset of Python syntax so that you can run some
pieces of Pyzza code in a python interpreter (e.g. for unittesting),
because running Python interpreter (even with plenty of mock Flash
classes) is much easier to automate. As you can see the aim is much different
than one for Jython or IronPython, and is much less challenge. This
simplification also allows us to make code running at native speed of AVM so
that you can choose between pyzza and ActionScript based on convenience and not
because speed reasons.

Since it's pet-project I have no time to make complete description of the
language so I'll give some highlight of differences between languages so you
can start hacking and maybe some day we will setup a complete guide.

Differences from Python
-----------------------

 * only ``from P.A.C.K.A.G.E import CLASSNAME`` form of import statement
    currently supported
 * ``import``s are compile-time ones
 * decorators are also compile-time only few are supported
 * attributes defined in class-body are static attributes
 * static attributes can be get only from class not from instance of suclass
    (limitation of AVM)
 * only tuple of strings can be value of ``__slots__``, this attribute is not
    accessible at runtime
 * ``def``s inside classes are bound to class statically (mostly limitation of
    ActionScript Bytecode/Virtual Machine)
 * apart from that any code can be in class body, local
    variables will be static members
 * global functions like ``range()``, ``len()`` etc. are not functions, they are
    inlined builtins. Also ``range()`` works only inside ``for`` statement
 * only positional arguments supported
 * only constant default values for arguments supported
 * to iterate over array you must use ``values(array)`` to iterate over dict
    there is ``keys()``, ``items()`` and ``values()`` and they all are inlined
    functions, by default ``for`` assumes expression is generator (not
    implemented yet)

Differences from ActionScript
-----------------------------

 * Your file structure is not limited you can create any class in any package
    in any file
 * No namespaces support. Everything is public (it's python property, but
    maybe we will add support of namespaces throught decorators, if we'll find
    a good reason for that, e.g. a good perfomance improvements)
 * No E4X support, currently (looking forward on how to fix it to not become of
    superset of python syntax)
 * No typed arguments or typed variables, no variable declarations either
