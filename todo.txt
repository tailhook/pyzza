Implement try...finally
Implement compilation of all node types (arithmetics, etc.)
Implement loop primitives (zip, enumerate)
Fill global namespace
Make syntax error reporting even better
Implement functions in global(package) namespace
Allow other files
Mandatory optimizations:
    * remove zero jumps
    * "getlocal 1" -> "getlocal_1"
    * returnvoid just after returnvalue
Optional optimizations:
    * optimize constant arithmetics (easy)
    * reuse variables (hard)
    * merging several DoABC tags (moderate, but tedious)
    * ifs with single comparison optimize to specialized jump (moderate)
    * setlocal, getlocal -> dup, setlocal (easy)
    * sort activation slots according to usage frequency (easy)
    * derive variable types, optimize method dispatch and int arithmetic (hard)
