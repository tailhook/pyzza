Fix call of super and constructors (seems done, but check please)
Make overridable methods
Implement try...finally
Implement compilation of all node types (arithmetics, etc.)
Implement while loop
Implement loop primitives (range, keys, values, items)
For creates new variables. Fix, so that it can reuse variable
Fill global namespace
Write debugging info
Make syntax error reporting even better
Allow other functions
Implement function closures
Allow other files
Try merging several DoABC tags for optimization
Use try...except in unittests
Mandatory optimizations:
    * remove zero jumps
    * "getlocal 1" -> "getlocal_1"
Optional optimisations:
    * optimize constant arithmetics (easy)
    * reuse variables (hard)
