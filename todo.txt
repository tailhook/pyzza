Implement try...finally
Implement compilation of all node types (arithmetics, etc.)
Implement subscription (square brackets)
Implement while loop
Implement loop primitives (range, keys, values, items, zip, enumerate)
For and except create new variables. Fix, so that they can reuse variables
Fill global namespace
Make syntax error reporting even better
Allow other functions
Implement function closures
Allow other files
Mandatory optimizations:
    * remove zero jumps
    * "getlocal 1" -> "getlocal_1"
Optional optimisations:
    * optimize constant arithmetics (easy)
    * reuse variables (hard)
    * merging several DoABC tags (moderate, but tedious)
    * ifs with single comparison optimize to specialized jump
